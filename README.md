# Bionic Reading Tool

Use this tool to read long texts with ease. Inspired by [bionic reading](https://bionic-reading.com/). 

## How To Use

Place desired text in a .txt file. Then call 

```
./bionic.bash {file.txt} {output-file.txt} {threshold}
```

where ```threshold``` (1-10) describes how much of each word to bold (with 1 being full-bolding).

## To Work On

Compatiability with PDF, formatted HTML page, easier UI...
