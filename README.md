# bionic-reading

Use this tool to read long texts with ease. Inspired by [bionic reading](https://bionic-reading.com/). 

## How to use

Place desired text in a .txt file. Then call 
'''
./bionic.bash {file.txt} {output-file.txt} {threshold}
'''
where '''threshold''' (1-10) describes how much of each word to bold (with 1 being full-bolding).

## To work on

Compatiability with PDF, formatted HTML page, easier UI...
